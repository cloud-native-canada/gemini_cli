# KubeNav

[kubenav](https://kubenav.io/) is the navigator for your Kubernetes clusters right in your pocket.



Kubenav is an opensource UI on top on Kubernetes. Works on Apple iOS, Android and most Desktop OS.

Itâ€™s a little difficult to configure when using a cloud resource, and the docs are gone at the moment. 

Check them on [Github](https://github.com/kubenav/docs/blob/master/docs/index.md)
