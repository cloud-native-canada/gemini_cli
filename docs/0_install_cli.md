## 1. Gemini CLI Installation

Before you do the setup and run Gemini CLI, let us create a folder that you will be using as our home folder for all the projects that you may create inside of it. This is a starting point for the Gemini CLI to work with, though it will also reference some other folders on your system and which you will come to later, as needed.

Go ahead and create a sample folder (`gemini-cli-projects`) and navigate to that via the commands shown below. If you prefer to use some other folder name, please do so.

```bash
mkdir gemini-cli-projects
```

Let's navigate to that folder:

```bash
cd gemini-cli-projects
```

**Note**: If you are using Google Cloud Shell, the Gemini CLI is already installed. You can directly launch Gemini CLI via the `gemini` command. Please navigate directly to the next section (Gemini CLI configuration via settings.json).

If you want to install Gemini CLI locally, follow the instructions given below.

### Install Node 20 +

```

**Note**: Make sure update "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME" wit project with Gemini Code Assist License.


=== "Windows"

Option 1. local Environment variable
