# Shell Setup

As of now, `kubectl` is installed and can reach two working local clusters. Still, we are required to type the `kubectl` command (7 letters) quite often. Too often.

We also have no knowledge of *which cluster am I connected to ?* or *what is my default namespace ?*.

Let's now configure the `shell` to solve all of those problems.

## I'm typing too much `kubectl` commands 

First trick is to use `k` as an alias to `kubectl`.

This is 6 less caracteres to type for every command !

=== "zsh"
    ```bash linenums="1" title="~/.zshrc"
    alias k=kubectl
    ```

=== "bash"
    ```bash linenums="1" title="~/.bashrc"
    alias k=kubectl
    ```

## Faster `kubectl` argument typing

`completion` is the term used in UNIXâ„¢ shells when it comes to empowering the shell with better knowledge of the commands we use.

Let's add those commands to the shell config file. A restart of the shell is needed for it to take effect:

=== "zsh"
    ```bash linenums="1" title="~/.zshrc"
    autoload -Uz compinit
    compinit
    source <(kubectl completion zsh)
    ```

=== "bash"
    ```bash linenums="1" title="~/.bashrc"
    source <(kubectl completion bash)
    complete -o default -F __start_kubectl k
    ```

With Completion setup, you can type `kubectl <tab>` or `k <tab>` to get help. `k po<tab>` will get completed to `k port-forward`

`bash` requires another command to make `k` also use completion.

## My `kubectl` commands are failing

Some OS, including MacOsX, comes with a really low value for the number of concurrent Open File Descriptors.

This low limit may break some `kubectl` commands or some other tools using the Kubernetes Go client like `helm`. 

To solve that, increase your File Descriptors to at lease 2048:

=== "zsh"
    ```bash linenums="1" title="~/.zshrc"
    ulimit -n 2048          # kubectl opens one cnx (file) per resource
    ```

=== "bash"
    ```bash linenums="1" title="~/.bashrc"
    ulimit -n 2048          # kubectl opens one cnx (file) per resource
    ```

## Cloud commands

Most people uses some flavour of Cloud hosted K8s clusters. This section is about the main K8s Cloud Providers.
### Gcloud

#### Install

=== "Apple Mac OSX"
    ```bash
    brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
    ```

=== "Linux"
    Refer to [the official doc](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install?hl=fr#linux).

    ```bash
    curl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-cli-405.0.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
    tar -xf google-cloud-cli-405.0.1-linux-x86.tar.gz
    ./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
    ```

=== "Windows"
    TODO

#### Setup

You can then init and configure `gcloud`:

```bash
# Install kubectl if you don't already have it
# gcloud components install kubectl # Optional

gcloud init
gcloud auth login

gcloud config set compute/region us-east1
```

Add your `GKE` clusters to your `kubectl` context (you can always find this command in the `Connect` tab in the Gcloud Web Console):

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster> --project <project>
```

#### Usage

Add those lines to enable completion:

=== "Apple Mac OSX ZSH"
    ```bash linenums="1" title="~/.zshrc"
    source "/usr/local/Caskroom/google-cloud-sdk/latest/google-cloud-sdk/path.zsh.inc"
    source "/usr/local/Caskroom/google-cloud-sdk/latest/google-cloud-sdk/completion.zsh.inc"
    ```

=== "Apple Mac OSX BASH"
    ```bash linenums="1" title="~/.bashrc"
    source "/usr/local/Caskroom/google-cloud-sdk/latest/google-cloud-sdk/path.bash.inc"
    source "/usr/local/Caskroom/google-cloud-sdk/latest/google-cloud-sdk/completion.bash.inc"
    ```

=== "Linux ZSH"
    ```bash linenums="1" title="~/.zshrc"
    # path may vary depending on where you installed gcloud command
    $HOME/kubernetes/google-cloud-sdk/path.zsh.inc
    $HOME/kubernetes/google-cloud-sdk/completion.zsh.inc
    ```

=== "Linux BASH"
    ```bash linenums="1" title="~/.bashrc"
    # path may vary depending on where you installed gcloud command
    $HOME/kubernetes/google-cloud-sdk/path.bash.inc
    $HOME/kubernetes/google-cloud-sdk/completion.bash.inc
    ```

### AWS CLI

#### Install

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```

#### Setup

Setup SSO ans default AWS profile. This is not mandatory but is a great helper if you're using SSO:

```bash
unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
aws configure sso
aws sso login --profile profile_xxxxxx
export AWS_PROFILE=profile_xxxxxx
```

Add your `EKS` clusters to your `kubectl` context:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig \ 
    --region us-east-1    \
    --name <cluster_name> \
    --alias <friendly_name>

```

#### Completions

Add those lines to your shell startup script:

=== "ZSH"
    ```bash linenums="1" title="~/.zshrc"
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 # update to your preference
    export AWS_PAGER="" # prevent aws cli to auto-page = display inline
    export BROWSER=echo # Do not open a browser, let you choose which browser to open
    # AWS CLI completions
    complete -C '/usr/local/bin/aws_completer' aws
    ```

=== "BASH"
    ```bash linenums="1" title="~/.bashrc"
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 # update to your preference
    export AWS_PAGER="" # prevent aws cli to auto-page = display inline
    export BROWSER=echo # Do not open a browser, let you choose which browser to open
    # AWS CLI completions
    complete -C '/usr/local/bin/aws_completer' aws
    ```

### Azure

    TODO
## ZSH shell

Mac OSX default shell is now `zsh` so we'll focus on ZSH now on. ZSH is also widely available in Linux and may somtimes be the default too.

!!! note "ZSH deprecation warning"
    To get rid of the deprecation warning in OSX, export this variable in your shell. Add it to your `.zshrc` file for persistance:

    ```bash linenums="1" title="~/.zshrc"
    export BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1
    ```
### Oh My ZSH !

Oh My Zsh is a delightful, open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration. It comes bundled with thousands of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and a few things that make you shout... `"Oh My ZSH!"`

#### Install

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

#### Theme

##### PowerLevel10k

There are many great themes out there to help developers to become more productive and make the Terminal look cool.
On such theme is `PowerLevel10k`. It's easy to install and provides a ton of tooling in your shell. It's available in a git repo that you have to clone in your `.oh-my-zsh`  custom folder.

!!! note "Fonts"
    When using iTerm2 or Termux, p10k configure can install the recommended font automatically. Simply answer Yes when asked whether to install Meslo Nerd Font.

    Else, [read the docs](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#manual-font-installation) to learn how to install the needed fonts.

=== "OSX"

    ```bash
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
    sed -i ' ' -e 's/^ZSH_THEME=".*"/ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k\/powerlevel10k"/g'  ~/.zshrc
    zsh
    ```

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
    sed 's/^ZSH_THEME=".*"/ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k\/powerlevel10k"/g' -i ~/.zshrc
    zsh
    ```

When opening a ZSH shell for the first time (done by calling `zsh` above), a menu will appear and ask some questions to setup the shell to your convenience.

This setup phase can be restarted anytime with the command `p10k configure`

Here are the answers to get a cool but productive shell:

- `prompt style`: `rainbow` is generally the best look(3)
- `Character Set`: `Unicode` (1)
- `Show current time`: use 24h (2)
- `Prompt Separators`: Angled (1)
- `Prompt Heads`: Sharp (1)
- `Prompt Tails`: Flat (1)
- `Prompt Height`: using only one line is better when copy/pasting (1)
- `Prompt Connection`: (if `Prompt Height` is set to 2): Disconnected (1)
- `Prompt Frame`: (if `Prompt Height` is set to 2): No Frame (1)
- `Prompt Spacing`: Compact (1)
- `Icons`: Many (2)
- `Prompt Flow`: Concise (1)
- `Enable Transient Prompt?`: Yes (y)
- `Instant Prompt Mode`: speed up slow scripts... set to Verbose as recommended (1)
- `Apply changes to ~/.zshrc`: Damn YES (y)

##### Agnoster

[Agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) is another cool theme, but less powerful than PowerLevel10k.

#### Plugins

ZSH uses plugins that extend the shortcuts and other behaviours for default apps. Here's some that are worth using:

```yaml
plugins=(brew kubectl git python tmux vault terraform)
```

Once those plugins are installed and the shell is reloaded, a ton of new Aliases are created. Use `alias` command to list them all. Here are a few:

```bash
alias | grep git

g=git
ga='git add'
gaa='git add --all'
gam='git am'
```

##### kubectl plugin

This plugin ads a ton of aliases specific to `kubectl`, usually based on the action to take, like `kgp` for `Kubectl Get Pods`.

``` bash
alias | grep kubectl

k=kubectl
kaf='kubectl apply -f'
kca='_kca(){ kubectl "$@" --all-namespaces;  unset -f _kca; }; _kca'
kccc='kubectl config current-context'
...
```

Because the plugin `kubectl` already create the alias `k=kubectl`, we don't need it explicitely in our `.zshrc` file. You can safely remove it.
Note that the aliases are all calling `kubectl` explicitelly.

##### zsh-autosuggestions plugin

TBD

##### zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin

TBD

#### Dynamic Prompt

Oh My ZSH! now have an eat feature called the dynamic prompt. Instead of having a prompt line which actually takes 3 lines and display your Git repo, Kubernetes Context, AWS or GCP account all the time, the needed information can be displayed only when needed.

In the case of Kubernetes, it means only when using the `kubectl` command, or any associated or similar commands like `k`.

It is possible to add more commands that will trigger the display of the prompt section by editing the `~/.p10k.zsh` file. Search for the variable `POWERLEVEL9K_KUBECONTEXT_SHOW_ON_COMMAND` and edit the line.

```bash
  typeset -g POWERLEVEL9K_KUBECONTEXT_SHOW_ON_COMMAND='kubectl|helm|kubens|kubectx|oc|istioctl|kogito|k9s|helmfile|flux|fluxctl|stern|kubeseal|kubecolor|skaffold'
```
