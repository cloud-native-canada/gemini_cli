## First interaction with Gemini CLI

Let's get started with Gemini CLI and type your first query as shown below:

```
Give me a famous quote on Artificial Intelligence and who said that?
```

The expected response is shown below:

You will notice that our query resulted in a `GoogleSearch` tool (an in-built tool in Gemini CLI) that got invoked. In other words, you have already exercised one of Gemini CLI's powerful in-built tools namely `GoogleSearch` that grounds its responses based on information that it gets from the web. You will learn more about Tools in the next section.

A quick way to understand Gemini CLI and the various commands that it supports is to type `/help` (forward slash) and you will see a variety of commands and keyboard shortcuts as shown below:

Let's quit Gemini CLI for now. You can do that either via the `/quit` command or you can do `Ctrl-C` twice in the interactive Gemini CLI terminal session.
